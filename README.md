# Explanation of selected approach
- I have selected not to create 'components' folder and add all css files into 'style' folder, because of simplicity of the project
- Since the requirement was not to overcomplicate things - I have deciced not create multiple folder structures and not to devide application into layers
- Because of the same reason I have decided not to create reusable styles and color variables,but simply copied the styles

Hope that this was exactly what you asked for.

Thank you in advance for time, that you spent on evaluation!
